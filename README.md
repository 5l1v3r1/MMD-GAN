# Official Tensorflow implementation for reproducing the results of [*Demystifying MMD GANs*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01401).

The repository contains code for reproducing experiments of uncoditional image generation with MMD GANs and other benchmark GAN models.

If you're only interested in the new KID metric, check out [`compute_scores.py`](gan/compute_scores.py).

### Model features
- Uses gradient penalty, analoguous to WGAN-GP ([Gulrajani et al *Improved Training of Wassersein GAN*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028). 
- Evaluates models using three different methods: [*Inception Score*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498), [*Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500), and proposed *Kernel Inception Distance (KID)*.
- Adaptively decreses the learning rate using 3-sample test. If KID does not improve (as compared to evaluation 20k steps earlier) three times in a row, learning rate is halved.

### Requirements
- python >= 3.6
- tensorflow-gpu >= 1.3
- PIL, lmdb, numpy, matplotlib
- machine with GPU(s). At least 2 GPUs are needed for experiments with Celeb-A dataset.

### Datasets
The code works with several common datasets with different resolutions. The experiments include
- 28x28 MNIST,
- 32x32 Cifar10,
- 64x64 LSUN Bedrooms,
- 160x160 Celeb-A.
 
LSUN, MNIST and Celeb-A datasets can be downloaded using the [script](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow/blob/master/download.py).

### Benchmarks

We compare MMD GANs with [WGAN-GP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028) and [Cramer GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10743).


### Running the code
Each of the following scripts launches the training of MMD GAN on respective dataset: `mnist.sh`, `cifar10.sh`, `lsun.sh`, `celeba.sh`. To train the benchmark models, change the variable `$MODEL` to `WGAN` or `CRAMER`. To train all three models set `$MODEL=ALL`.

questions and issues.
